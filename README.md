This is my own collection of general-purpose reusable game libraries. More info and screenshots to come!

AECORE

The lowest level of C code, responsible for system-level stuff like timers, math, image codecs and processing, triangle mesh transformation, etc.

AEGAME
------
A Python wrapper for aecore.

PYXL
----
A simple SNES-style 2D game engine, featuring a unique Smalltalk-esque object system.

MASH3D

A fairly basic 3D engine, compatible with PYXL and utilizing the same general structure.
